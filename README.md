# Disable App / Window Switcher Popup Hover in Gnome 45+

This Gnome Extension prevents the mouse cursor interfering with either the App Switcher or the Window Switcher popups.
Note: It doesn't prevent mouse clicks.

These are the switcher popups that are invoked from keyboard shortcuts, e.g. Alt+Tab or Super+Tab.

Based on <https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4714/disable-hover-on-app-window-switcher-popups/> (for Gnome <45)
